# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Classification
This project aims to develop an effective machine learning classification model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients based on clinical and diagnostic features. The model applies various algorithms to analyze medical attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and chest pain type. It can help in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

The dataset used is taken from the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
